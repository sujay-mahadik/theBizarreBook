# The Bizarre Book
A collection of small short bizarre and mostly vain ideas of intermixing technological advancements with daily life.
## Technology
### 1. BarbAR  :scissors:
Every person who has ever been to a local hairdressing salon has heard or experience small injuries due to scissors/blades. What if AR - Augmented Reality headsets along with motion sensors hand held devices be made available for barbers to train on? Points will be deducted for every mistake committed in AR and the barber with higher score will eventually be a better barber.

### 2. Back Screen  :vertical_traffic_light:  :car:
Honking is pretty common when you want to alert the car that you are coming up on them, but honking nanoseconds after the lights turn green or when you are in a traffic which only seems to end at the horizon, annoys pretty much every other sane driver. There are often times when we want to ~~cuss~~  * coughs *  politely convey something to the honker. Well here's an idea of installing Speech-to-Text LCD Display panel at the back of your car, which will display the message you speak. Something on the lines of what you do with your Google Assistant or Alexa or Siri. A trigger word followed by the ~~cuss~~ * damn this cough * you want to convey.
```
"Ok Honker!"                //Trigger
"Is everthing alright?"     //Message

"Ok Honker!"            //Trigger
"Udke jayega kya bc?"   //Message
```
Pretty soothing right?

### 3. ageinJPEG   :hourglass:  :camera: 
The point of a picture is to save a frame from time which otherwise is lost. But consider this idea of ageing pictures, yes, this means the selfie you took 5 years ago will not show the old you, instead the picture will show how you look today with the background still remaining old with an option to change it into what it would look today.

Spooky?

### 4. Virtual Clothing or No Clothing
With the use of LIDAR technology, we can built the virtual clothing app. So from now u can enjoy spending weekends at home. or simply imagine shopping without the rush to change in changing room for try outs!! and most importantly you dont have to wear clothes wore by some random person. Store can implement this like keeping human size screen in stores which will able to choose them from various available clothes in the store and if dey like something dey can buy it or try it out few of dem.

### 5. AI Based meeting assistant
Everyone one who is working in It Company or and other software company may have face this problem about making notes while attending call or daily sync. The Al assistant will take out notes about individual task which he/she has to complete by the EOD. These will help people to be focus in meeting rather than multitasking of making notes and understanding problems. It saves lot of time of developer as well as of manager.

## Polity
### 1. Religion 18+ :underage:
In India Voter ID, Election card, Permanent motor vehicle driving license, PAN - Permanent Account Number along with a few more "essential" documents are issued at the age of 18. There has been a numerous discussions upon reservations against caste, minority communities etc. What if Religion/Caste are made available as a choice at the age of 18. Better yet what if a behavioral assessment is developed which assigns a particular Religion/Caste as the end result? Of course there will be a choice option of no-religion given to the candidates.
